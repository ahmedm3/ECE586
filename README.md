- python CPU.py -mem /path/to/memory/image

where /path/to/memory/image/ is the path the image file which is in the current directory
Thus the command becomes 

- python CPU.py -mem mem_file


Testing:

To test each component separately, please run the following commands:

For the ALU:

- python ALU.py

For the Memory:

- python Memory.py

For the instruction decoder:

- python instruction_decoder.py

Thank you for using the simulator!
